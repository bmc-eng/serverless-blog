# Serverless Blog

This project is a simple serverless blog post site using AWS where you can enter blog posts and have them display on a site without needing to set up a server to host the posts. Its intended as a single user site. It uses API Gateway, Lambda and Dynamo DB as the backend and React as front end. I have used Amplify to build and am using react bootstrap for the styling.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
